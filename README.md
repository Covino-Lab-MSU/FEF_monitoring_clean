## Data cleaning for the Fraser Experimental Forest project monitoring

This repository uses data downloaded from field instrumentation maintained within streams and shallow groundwater wells within the Fraser Experimental Forest

### Tasks:
    
   * Aggregate all downloaded files for a given stream reach and instrument type
   * Look for anomalies within the data and remove data not representative of environmental parameters
   * Compare instrumenation readings with manual readings (if available) and make adjustments as necessary 
   * Visualize clean data
   * Output clean data to 'clean' data file for future use in analysis
    
### Setup:
    
Cleaning scripts are found in the src folder. Required functions are found in the functions folder and are labeled by data type or instrumentation, using the same nomenclature as the cleaning script. Additional markdown documents intended to summarize data are stored...
   
#### Data Collection  and analysis 

R script required to collect, review, and analyze data are contained in the "scripts" directory and numbered according to workflow  All datasets and output folders are currently maintained locally (later: can be imported from..?)
